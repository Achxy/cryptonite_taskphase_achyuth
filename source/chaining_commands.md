# Chaining Commands

### Chaining with semicolons
Execute `/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college` to run both commands sequentially. The semicolon (`;`) chains the commands.
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{csjgABMaMkaMV3OOaxxEaNHzVBn.dVTN4QDLxUjN0czW}
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ 
```
