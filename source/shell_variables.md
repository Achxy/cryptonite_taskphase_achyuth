# Shell variables

### Printing variables
There's a variable named `FLAG`, we'll prepend it with `$` forming `$FLAG` and pass it to `echo` to have it displayed.
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{Yz881o8y6bSKn6_k9BCiqeMG404.ddTN1QDLxUjN0czW}
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ 
```
